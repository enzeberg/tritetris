# Tritetris
Tritetris provides you a triangle to hold the Tetris blocks. You can rotate the triangle to choose the best side you think to receive the falling block every time. It's very interesting and you need to use some strategies to get a score as
high as possible.

## How to play
### for Desktop
- Arrow Keys: move the Tetris blocks
- Up Arrow Key: deform the Tetris blocks
- A / D: rotate the triangle
### for Mobile
Touch the **canvas** to move the Tetris blocks.

## Tips
The more squares you clear at once, the higher the score you get!

## Note
- When the falling tetromino is totally under the minddle thin line, you can't rotate the triangle.
- When the falling tetromino hits the squares fixed on the triangle after rotating, the tetromino goes up to avoid covering the still squares.
